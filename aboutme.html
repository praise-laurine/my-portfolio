      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hello!<br>
        I am Laurine Praise grew up in a family of four siblings and my passion in coding started in high school at Kariobangi North Girls Secondary School.During my high school years I had passion in coding and now have joined Moringa school to better my skills and
        pursue programming as a career. I decided to take a class in progamming at Moringa school to gain more knowledge
        and expound my skills in coding. coding is interesting and dynamic in that it can help solve some of our
        community's problems and i see myself in years time as a great software developer ready to change our community.
